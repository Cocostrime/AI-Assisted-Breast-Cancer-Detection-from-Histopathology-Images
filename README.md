# AI-Assisted-Breast-Cancer-Detection-from-Histopathology-Images

## 🎯 Objectives
- Develop a CNN-based automated system for breast cancer detection  
- Perform:
  - **Binary classification** (Benign / Malignant)
  - **Multiclass classification** (8 tumor categories)
- Combine images from **all magnification levels (40X, 100X, 200X, 400X)**
- Reduce computational cost using **transfer learning**
- Evaluate performance using standard metrics

---

## 🗂️ Dataset Description
The dataset consists of **approximately 7500 histopathological breast scan images** captured at four different magnification levels:
- 40X  
- 100X  
- 200X  
- 400X  

📎 **Dataset Access:**  
The dataset is privately stored and shared via a **Google Drive link** (https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1I2EFBgeyb9Lr1sdBtAZST1reEjCpkX3k?usp=share_link).
